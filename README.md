What are the macronutrient profiles of American, Chinese, and Mexican cuisines?

In examining the macronutrient breakdown of American, Chinese, and Mexican cuisines, we find some notable distinctions. Generally, these culinary traditions share similarities in their macronutrient compositions, yet nuanced differences emerge. For instance, American dishes tend to be richer in protein content, while Chinese recipes often lean towards higher carbohydrate levels.

Which cuisine is most accessible to people with allergies/intolerances to dairy and/or gluten?

The American diet stands out as the most accommodating for individuals with dairy or gluten allergies. This accessibility is attributed to the growing availability of gluten and dairy-free options in the American culinary landscape. The demand for such products has surged since 2016, with a consistent year-to-year increase.

Which cuisine (Mexican, American, or Chinese) is most in line with the UDH recommended macronutrient breakdown?

The Chinese diet aligns most closely with the UDH (Universal Dietary Guidelines) recommended macronutrient breakdown. Scientific studies indicate that traditional Chinese foods and recipes exhibit a healthier and more balanced profile compared to the traditional American diet. The foundation of the traditional Chinese diet primarily comprises plant-based foods, a modest inclusion of fish and poultry, occasional servings of red meat, and a staple presence of rice.

Are there outliers that are skewing one of the cuisines when broken down into carbs, protein, and fat?

While a few outliers have been identified, none seem to exert a drastic influence on the overall data distribution. The macronutrient breakdowns of these cuisines remain relatively consistent, with any deviations being within an acceptable range that doesn't significantly distort the overall picture.
